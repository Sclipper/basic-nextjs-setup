This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First create a folder with the name of the new project and cd into it

```bash
mkdir {projectName}
```

```bash
cd {projectName}
```

Then clone this repo in that location 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sclipper/basic-nextjs-setup.git .
```

Next remove the current origin

```bash
git remote remove origin
```

Create a new repository and copy the code that github provides 

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/${nickname}/${projectName}.git
git branch -M master
git push -u origin master
```

Dont forget to change the readme :)
